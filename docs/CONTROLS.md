# üéÆ Guide to Customizing controls.ini

This document explains how to configure your input devices by editing the `controls.ini` file. This file gives you full control over how your keyboard, mouse, joysticks, and gamepads are mapped to in-game actions.

## üìÑ 1. Generating the Default File

Before you start, it's highly recommended to generate a fresh, default `controls.ini` file. This gives you a complete template with all possible actions and recommended starting points for your controls.

To generate the file, run the application from your terminal with the `--create` flag, followed by the argument `controls`.

**Basic Command:**
This will create a file named `controls.ini` in the current directory.
```bash
./lindbergh --create controls
```

**Specifying a Path:**
You can also specify a path to create the file in a different location. The folder must already exist.

- **Create in a specific folder:**
  ```bash
  ./lindbergh --create controls ./my/folder/
  ```
- **Create with a custom name and location:**
  ```bash
  ./lindbergh --create controls ./my/path/to/mycontrols.ini
  ```

## üìÇ 2. Structure of the INI File

The file is organized into sections, each marked with a name in square brackets (e.g., `[Config]`). Under each section are key-value pairs, separated by an equals sign (`=`).

```ini
[SectionName]
Key = Value1, Value2, ...
```

- **Section:** A category of settings (e.g., `[Driving]`, `[Shooting]`). The game automatically loads the `[Common]` section plus one other section that matches the game's type.
- **Key:** The name of the logical in-game action you want to map (e.g., `P1_Start`, `Steer`, `Trigger`).
- **Value:** One or more physical input strings, separated by commas, that will trigger the action.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Configuration Sections

### [Config]

This section contains global settings that affect all input devices.

- **`<ActionName>_DeadZone`**: Sets a custom analog deadzone for a specific logical action. This gives you precise control over actions like steering and pedals. The value is from `0` (no deadzone) to `32767`. If not specified, a sensible default is used (a large deadzone for centering sticks, a small one for non-centering pedals/triggers).
  - **Example:** `Steer_DeadZone = 7000`
  - **Example for Player 2:** `P2_Gas_DeadZone = 500`
- **`ShakeIncreaseRate` / `ShakeDecayRate`**: Controls the gun shaking effect in games like *House of the Dead 4*.

### [ControllerGUIDs]

This section is managed automatically by the application to ensure your controllers are always assigned to the correct player.

- **`P<N>_GUID`**: Stores the unique hardware ID for the controller assigned to Player `<N>`. You should not need to edit this section manually.
- **Swapping Players**: If you have multiple controllers and want to change which one is Player 1 vs. Player 2, you can do so by swapping the GUID strings between the `P1_GUID` and `P2_GUID` keys.
- **Resetting Assignments**: If you want to reset all controller assignments, you can delete this entire section. The application will regenerate it on the next launch based on the order the controllers are detected.

### Game Type Sections

These sections contain the actual control mappings. The application will load `[Common]` and one other section based on the game being played.

-   **`[Common]`**: For actions shared by all games (Test, Coin, Start, Service).
-   **`[Digital]`**: For standard arcade games with an 8-way joystick and buttons.
-   **`[Driving]`**: For racing games with analog steering, gas, and brake.
-   **`[Shooting]`**: For lightgun games.
-   **`[ABC]`**: For games with flight-stick style controls like *After Burner Climax*.
-   **`[Mahjong]`**: For mahjong panel controls.

## üïπÔ∏è 4. Understanding Controller Mappings (gamecontrollerdb.txt)

For the application to recognize your gamepad (like an Xbox or PlayStation controller) and allow you to use the simple `GC` bindings (e.g., `GC0_BUTTON_A`), it needs a database of controller mappings.

-   **Built-in Mappings**: The application already includes a large, built-in database of mappings for hundreds of common controllers, so many devices will work out of the box.
-   **Adding Custom Mappings**: If you have a rare controller or want to override the built-in behavior, you can provide an external mapping file. The file can have any name (though `gamecontrollerdb.txt` is standard) but must follow the SDL mapping format. You can load a custom file by running the application with the `--controllerdb` flag:
    ```bash
    ./lindbergh --controllerdb ./path/to/your_mappings.txt
    ```
    The mappings from your file will be added to the existing built-in database.
-   **Where to get mapping files**: You can find the community-sourced `gamecontrollerdb.txt` file, which is a great starting point for custom mappings, at the [official SDL GameControllerDB GitHub repository](https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB).

## ‚å®Ô∏è 5. Binding String Syntax

The value for each key is a comma-separated list of physical input strings. Here is the format for each device type:

### Keyboard

-   **Format**: `KEY_<ScanCodeName>`
-   **Example**: `KEY_A, KEY_Space, KEY_ArrowUp`
-   **Note**: The name is the SDL Scancode Name, not necessarily the character on the key.

### Mouse

-   **Buttons**: `MOUSE_LEFT_BUTTON`, `MOUSE_RIGHT_BUTTON`, `MOUSE_MIDDLE_BUTTON`
-   **Axes**: `MOUSE_AXIS_X`, `MOUSE_AXIS_Y`

### Generic Joysticks (JOY) and Standard Gamepads (GC)

-   **Player Index `<N>`**: The number `<N>` after `JOY` or `GC` always refers to the player. The application uses the `[ControllerGUIDs]` section to determine which physical device is assigned to which player. `JOY0_` and `GC0_` will always be the controller assigned to Player 1, `JOY1_` and `GC1_` will be for Player 2, and so on.
-   **Buttons**:
    -   `JOY<N>_BUTTON_<ButtonNumber>` (e.g., `JOY0_BUTTON_0`)
    -   `GC<N>_BUTTON_<ButtonName>` (e.g., `GC0_BUTTON_A`, `GC0_BUTTON_LEFTSHOULDER`)
-   **Hats/D-Pads**: `JOY<N>_HAT<HatNumber>_<Direction>` (e.g., `JOY0_HAT0_UP`)
-   **Axes**:
    -   `JOY<N>_AXIS_<AxisNumber>` (e.g., `JOY0_AXIS_0`)
    -   `GC<N>_AXIS_<AxisName>` (e.g., `GC0_AXIS_LEFTX`, `GC0_AXIS_TRIGGERRIGHT`)

### Axis Suffixes (for JOY and GC axes)

You can add suffixes to an axis string to change its behavior:

-   **`_POSITIVE` / `_NEGATIVE`**: Treats one direction of an analog axis like a digital button press.
    -   **Example**: `P1_Right = GC0_AXIS_LEFTX_POSITIVE`
-   **`_POSITIVE_HALF` / `_NEGATIVE_HALF`**: Used to map two different triggers or pedals to a single combined analog action (like a throttle).
    -   **Example**: `Throttle = JOY0_AXIS_5_POSITIVE_HALF, JOY0_AXIS_2_NEGATIVE_HALF`
-   **`_INVERTED`**: Reverses the direction of an analog axis.
    -   **Example**: `Throttle = GC0_AXIS_RIGHTY_INVERTED`

### Example

Here is a complex mapping for Player 1's "Start" button:

```ini
P1_Start = KEY_1, GC0_BUTTON_START, JOY0_BUTTON_9
```

This means the action will be triggered by pressing the `'1'` key on the keyboard, the `'Start'` button on Player 1's gamepad, OR button number `9` on Player 1's generic joystick.
